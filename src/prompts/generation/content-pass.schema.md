Return JSON only, no prose outside it:

{
  "rooms": [
    {
      "ref": "<room ref, exactly as given>",
      "name": "<short room name>",
      "base": "<the room's standing description>",
      "entities": [ { "ref": "<entity ref>", "name": "<name>", "base": "<identity>", "position": "<one of the position words>" } ],
      "fixtures": [ { "kind": "<one from THIS room's menu>", "position": "<one of the position words>", "name": "<name>", "base": "<identity>" } ],
      "promotions": [ { "text": "<detail text as given>", "name": "<name>", "base": "<identity>", "hidden": false, "position": "<one of the position words>" } ],
      "connectors": [ { "ref": "<connector ref>", "name": "<what it is, naming neither room>", "form": "<what it physically is>", "requirement": "<gated only: what blocks it>" } ],
      "encounters": [
        {
          "ref": "<encounter ref>",
          "group": { "name": "<plural name>", "base": "<shared identity>", "activity": "<one line>", "stats": { "damage": "1d8" } },
          "distinct": [
            { "kind": "elite|named", "member": "<named: person id>", "name": "<name>", "base": "<identity>", "isLeader": false, "activity": "<one line>", "stats": { "armorDefense": 14 } }
          ]
        }
      ],
      "goal": { "entityType": "Item|RoomFeature|Creature", "name": "<name>", "base": "<identity>", "position": "<one of the position words>" }
    }
  ]
}

Include each key only when the room has it; "group" only when a mass is listed;
"distinct" only for specimens marked distinct; omit "goal" except in the GOAL
room. Leave "stats" out for an average creature.

"fixtures" and every "position" are optional and are omitted entirely for a room
with no "as drawn" line. NEVER put a count, a dimension, or a coordinate in any
of them: "kind" and "position" are words off the lists and nothing else.
